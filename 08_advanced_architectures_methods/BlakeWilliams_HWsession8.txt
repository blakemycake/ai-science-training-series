I could use AI for protein design. The task would be to identify new protein sequences with specific functionalities of interest, such as agonists for cytokine receptors. Since protein structure determines its function, I would use the sequence and structure information of known proteins in the family of interest and their homologs. I could use deep graph neural networks to design sequences that fold into specific shapes and by constraining the shape, I would be able to identify amino acids that would work in each position. Initially, I would test my algorithm on a subset of known proteins and see if I can predict similar sequences. For the metric, I would measure how accurately the algorithm could predict the known proteins by comparing the predicted sequence to the known sequence. I would take into consideration the different properties of amino acids and use a scoring matrix to adjust the accuracy calculation for similar but not identical amino acid predictions.
